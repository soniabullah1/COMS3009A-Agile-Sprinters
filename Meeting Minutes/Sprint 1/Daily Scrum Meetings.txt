*Thursday, 1 April 2021*
What I did yesterday: 
1. Colin and I had a meeting over Discord to discuss the best online database server to use. We agreed that Microsoft SQL would be the best given that we are familiar with the language. We also roughly planned the tables that we thought were needed for now. 

2. I set up the online database. I downloaded Docker and linked Microsoft SQL to the app. I then also downloaded Azure Data Studio, which is a database tool that will help us write queries and create tables. 

What I will do today: 
I will experiment with creating the tables on Azure Data Studio since I’m a little unfamiliar with this tool given that it’s my first time using it. I wrote a simple query last night and it ran perfectly fine but I just couldn’t get the actual table to show so I really want to get that working today. 

Any Impediments: 
I have quite a bit of lecture material to get through as well as a live lecture to attend so I may not have as much time to work on my task as I would have liked to have but I am still hoping to make some progress.
